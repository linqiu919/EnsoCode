## Why EnsoCode

EnsoCode is a local-first desktop agent workbench on Electron, powered by the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding agent harness. It is built to **orchestrate, supervise, and collaborate with a team of specialized agents** — not to answer one prompt at a time.

- **Task isolation**: Repos stay in the sidebar. One conversation per task. Same-repo parallelism can opt into Git worktrees (`enso/*`) so working trees do not collide.
- **Hierarchical dispatch**: Short, self-contained work goes to **Subagents** (isolated context, report, then exit). Multi-step collaboration goes to **Coworkers** (own tab, lasting memory, you can jump in anytime).
- **Review in the stream**: Diffs sit in the timeline. Three approval levels (full review, auto-accept edits, full access), plus Git checkpoints with one-click rewind.
- **Desk-free continuity**: Pair a PWA phone companion with a QR code. End-to-end encryption; the relay forwards ciphertext only.
- **Remote work**: Native SSH projects, or pair another EnsoCode desktop as a remote node.
- **Bring what you already have**: Import local Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor configs, keys, MCP servers, and session history.

## From install to first review

1. **Download** the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/J3n5en/EnsoCode/releases/latest).
2. **Connect a model** in Settings — or import providers from Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor.
3. **Pin a project** in the sidebar.
4. **Start a session.** Dispatch Subagents for one-shot work, or hire a Coworker for a longer thread.
5. **Review the result.** Inspect diffs, change the approval level, rewind a checkpoint if needed.

No EnsoCode account. Model traffic goes to the provider you configured.

## Core capabilities

### 1. Multi-task orchestration

| Mode | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Projects & sessions** | Several local repos in the sidebar. Each conversation has its own timeline, model, preset, pin, and archive state. |
| **Git worktree isolation** | Work on the main copy by default, or switch to an `enso/*` worktree for parallel branches. |
| **Subagents** | One-shot workers (`scout`, `tester`, `reviewer`, `worker`, …) in isolated context. They return a report and exit. |
| **Coworkers** | Long-lived peers in their own tabs. Watch, steer, or chat without stuffing the parent context. |
| **Background processes** | Dev servers, watchers, and long builds sit as live capsules above the composer. |

### 2. Review, safety, checkpoints

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Embedded diffs** | Reads, patches, and edits expand in the stream or the side panel. |
| **Three approval modes** | Full manual approval, auto-accept edits, or full access — switchable while a session runs. |
| **Git checkpoints** | Lightweight snapshots in `refs/enso-checkpoints` (up to 50 per session) before destructive writes. |

### 3. Keep a long task moving

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal tracking (`/goal`)** | Pin the outcome. The agent drives up to 25 auto-turns; pause or resume anytime. |
| **Steer & queue** | Queue follow-ups while it runs; edit or drop them, or interrupt immediately. |
| **Transient retries** | Network blips and provider 5xx retry with a visible countdown. |
| **Dockable side panel** | Files, session changes, split terminals, and an embedded browser. |

</p>
<p align="center"><sub>Files, Changes, Terminal, and Browser stay next to the conversation.</sub></p>

### 4. Phone companion and remote nodes

- **Phone companion**: Scan a QR code. Review history, approve, answer questions, steer. Relay sees ciphertext only.
- **Desktop remote node**: Pair two EnsoCode machines and operate sessions that live on the other desk.
- **SSH projects**: Run against a remote tree over SSH without mirroring the repo locally.

</p>
<p align="center"><sub>Pair in seconds. Encryption keys stay on the devices.</sub></p>

### 5. Extensibility

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skills, MCP, slash, `@`** | `/skill:` pills, `@` file and session autocomplete, multi-server MCP. |
| **Runtime presets** | Bundle model policy, skills, MCP, and system prompt. |
| **Import** | Scan local Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor setups; import keys, skills, MCP, instructions, and history. |
| **Appearance** | Ghostty terminal palettes, light/dark, background image, glass opacity. |
| **Status line** | Tokens, cost, elapsed time, context use, coworker count, approval mode. |

## Local-first, precisely

Local-first does not mean “never touches the network.”

| Data | Where it goes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Conversations | Local JSONL on this machine |
| Settings | Local app data |
| API keys | Local settings (Main process). Not sent to the phone catalog |
| Pairing secrets | OS encrypted storage when available |
| SSH passwords | System keychain |
| EnsoCode telemetry | None |
| Model requests | Direct to the provider or endpoint you configure |
| Phone / remote node | Optional. Default relay forwards **ciphertext only**; same LAN can connect directly |

There is no EnsoCode account and no Enso-hosted model proxy. If you use a remote model, that provider receives the context for the request under its own policy. The phone companion is optional; skip pairing and nothing leaves the desktop except model calls you make.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Run EnsoCode from source</strong></summary>

<br />

**Requirements:** Node.js `>= 22`, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) `>= 10`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

```bash
pnpm build:mac    # .dmg / .zip
pnpm build:win    # .exe
pnpm build:linux  # .AppImage / .deb
```

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Self-host the phone relay</strong></summary>

<br />

The public default is `https://enso-relay.j3.do`. To run your own, see [packages/relay/README.md](packages/relay/README.md):

- **Cloudflare Worker** (recommended): `pnpm --filter @enso/relay release`.
- **Go binary**: download `enso-relay-linux-amd64` / `enso-relay-linux-arm64` from the GitHub Release, `chmod +x`, run it.

Point **Settings → Devices → Relay URL** at your instance.
